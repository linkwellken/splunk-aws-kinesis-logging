# splunk-aws-kinesis-logging
This repo includes the Project Trumpet CF template that was used to deploy the Kinesis Firehose infrastructure in our AWS account for monitoring Chainlink and adapter logs being sent to Cloudwatch Logs groups.  Additionally, there is a lambda function example for filtering and parsing the logs to include on the fly sourcetype assignment and different index destinations based on the CW Logs group name.
